1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.
Middleware in an Express application is used to process incoming requests, 
perform actions like logging or authentication, modify request or response objects, 
and pass control to the next middleware or route handler using next(). 
It allows for modular and reusable request handling logic, enhancing application flexibility and maintainability.


2. What does CRUD stand for?
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete. It represents the four basic functions of persistent storage 
in computer applications and describes the fundamental operations for managing data in databases or through APIs:
Create: Adding new data or records.
Read: Retrieving existing data or records.
Update: Modifying existing data or records.
Delete: Removing existing data or records.
These operations are essential in any system that deals with data management, 
ranging from database systems to web applications and APIs.

3. You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
- How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
- How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository?
To access information in a .env file in my app, I use the dotenv package in Node.js. 
I load the file with require('dotenv').config() at the beginning of my application. 
To protect its contents, I add .env to .gitignore to prevent it from being stored in my GitHub repository.
